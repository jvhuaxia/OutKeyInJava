These changes only became possible as my memory improved. First it
was stored in tubes, then on transistors and later on very small
chips. As a result I totally changed my shape. As I have grown old
er I have also grown smaller. Over time my memory has developed so
much that, like an elephant, I never forget anything I have been
told! And my memory became so large that even I couldn't believe i
t! But I was always so lonely standing there by myself, until in e
arly 1960s they gave me a family connected by a network. I was abl
e to share my knowledge with others through the World Wide Web.
